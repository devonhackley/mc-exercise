One of the mistakes that the team committed was their lack of communication, especially when it came to committing and merging work. To be successful, both groups should have been as transparent as possible.

The team members should have done a git pull origin master, before making changes and pushing up to master. They also should have been working on separate branches instead of all working in master.

To avoid further messing with master, the team should have designated one person to be in charge all merges to master.
